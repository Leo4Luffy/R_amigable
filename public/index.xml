      <description>Social Data Science with R
 Daniel Anderson Brendan Cullen Ouafaa Hmaddi   In addition to the course books linked below, I am currently working on course notes for all of the classes. This may eventually turn into a published book, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m just thinking of it as course notes. Please feel free to use these as a supplemental resource (in addition to the slides and lectures). Also, please let me know if you&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute!</description>
