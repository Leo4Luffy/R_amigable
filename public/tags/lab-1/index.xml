      <description>true  Overview The purpose of this lab is to get you working with git and GitHub collaboratively, as well as to refresh some basic {dplyr} skills. You should work together in groups of 3-4.
The basics of the lab are to:
 Create a shared repo Create an R Markdown document Work on a few different data visualizations together  Different people make different commits  Submit a link to the repo through Canvas when you’ve completed the lab I check the commit history, and give each person credit  Data We’ll work with Week 1 of the #tidytuesday data for 2019, specifically the #rstats dataset, containing nearly 500,000 tweets over a little more than a decade using that hashtag.</description>
