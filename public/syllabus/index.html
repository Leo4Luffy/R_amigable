</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
<p>This is the second course in a sequence of courses that will eventually lead to an <em>educational data science</em> specialization. This course will be taught through <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a>, a free and open-source statistical computing environment. This course will give students a foundation in the principles and practice of data visualization, particularly as applied to scientific and technical data. We will have weekly lectures, covering a wide variety of topics including human perception, color theory, principles of visual design, etc. We will also have weekly hands-on laboratory sessions in which students will have the opportunity to put the lecture material into practice. Often when creating effective data visualizations, it is necessary to combine and transform different data sources, and this will be a considerable focus of the course as well.</p>
<h3 id="student-learning-objectives">Student Learning objectives</h3>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transform data in a variety of ways to create effective data visualizations</li>
<li>Understand and fluently apply different types of data joins</li>
<li>Customize graphics in a variety of ways (e.g., color choices, text annotations, categorical axis ordering)</li>
<li>Create an online data visualization portfolio</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="course-readings">Course Readings</h2>
<p>All course readings are freely available online or will be provided by the
instructor.</p>
<h3 id="books-required">Books (required)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Jenny Bryan, <a href="http://happygitwithr.com">Happy git with R</a>.</li>
<li>Kieran Healy, <a href="http://socviz.co/">Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction.</a> Forthcoming. Princeton University Press.</li>
<li>Claus Wilke, <a href="https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/">Fundamentals of Data Visualization.</a> Forthcoming. O&rsquo;Reilly.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will also have select readings from</p>
<ul>
<li>Hadley Wickham &amp; Garrett Grolemund, <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz">R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade will be composed of five components:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 labs at 6 points each (30 points; 15%)</li>
<li>2 homework assignments at 20 points each (40 points; 10%)</li>
<li>five-minute data visualization &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; presentation (10 points; 5%)</li>
<li>Final Project (120 points; 60%)
<ul>
<li>Proposal (10 points; 5%)</li>
<li>Draft (15 points; 7.5%)</li>
<li>Peer review (15 points; 7.5%)</li>
<li>Presentation (20 points; 10%)</li>
<li>Product (60 points; 30%)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labs">Labs</h3>
<p>There are 5 labs during the course, scored at 6 points each, which must be
submitted within one week of being assigned. Labs will include designated
in-class time, but any work not completed during class must be completed
on your own. Labs will be scored on a &ldquo;best honest effort&rdquo; basis, which
generally implies zero or full credit (i.e.,the assignment was or was not fully
completed). However, many of the labs require students complete specific
portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and
unable to proceed, <strong>please contact the instructor for help rather than
submitting incomplete work</strong>. Contacting the instructor is part of the &ldquo;best
honest effort&rdquo;, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the the
work is not fully complete. <strong>If the assignment is not complete, and the student
has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a score of
zero</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="homework">Homework</h3>
<p>Homework assignments are essentially extended labs, with two exceptions: (1) No
time will be designated during class to homework completion, and (2) homework
will be scored on a correct/incorrect basis. Two homework will be assigned, each
worth up to 20 points.</p>
<h3 id="data-visualizations-in-the-wild-presentation-10-points-5">Data visualizations &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; presentation (10 points; 5%)</h3>
<p>On the first day of the class you will be randomly assigned a date for a
presentation.</p>
<p>Presentations will start with the second meeting of class. The assignment requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifying two data visualizations intended for different audiences (e.g.,
scientific community, popular culture, data users [teachers/educators, etc.])</li>
<li>Sharing the data visualizations with the class, and discussing the following:
<ul>
<li>What is trying to be communicated?</li>
<li>How effective do you judge the visualization at communicating the content? Why?</li>
<li>At least one area of strength.</li>
<li>At least one potential area for improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this project is aimed at identifying a range of data visualizations.
It would be ideal if both model data visualizations and poor data visualizations
were presented from a variety of sources. Your two visualizations <strong>must</strong> be
aimed at separate audiences.</p>
<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>
<p>The final project will include a portfolio of your data visualizations. At least
<strong>three</strong> different data visualizations must be included, as well as the
history of how the visualization changed over time. Among these three
visualizations, at least one continuous variable and one categorical variable
must be included. The portfolios must be housed on <em>GitHub</em> and be
reproducible. In occasional situations, it can be helpful to make final
modifications to your plot through systems outside of R (e.g., Adobe
Illustrator, Inkscape). If you choose to make these modifications (not required)
they are the one (and only) acceptable exception to full reproducibility.</p>
<h4 id="proposal">Proposal</h4>
<p>At the end of Week 5, you must include a proposal of your data visualization
portfolio that includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Description of the data source (must be publicly available)</li>
<li>Preliminary ideas (even hand sketches) of different visualizations</li>
<li>Identification of the intended audience for each visualization
<ul>
<li>Note, you might consider displaying the same data/relations more than
once, with each plot displayed for a different audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The intended message to be communicated for each plot.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="portfolio-draft">Portfolio draft</h4>
<p>By the end of Week 8, you should have a fairly complete draft of the data
visualizations you will be sharing in your portfolio. These should be housed
on GitHub and ready to receive feedback from your peers.</p>
<h4 id="peer-review">Peer review</h4>
<p>You will be assigned to three of your peers code for their data visualizations.
The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an
immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all
ultimately end up at the same destination. In terms of visualization, there
is certainly plenty of room for artistic license, but certain design decisions
(as we will learn) can lead to more interpretable and better data
communication. Thus, peer review is a chance to not only learn from others, but
get feedback on your (expected to be in-progress) design decisions.</p>
<p>During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength,
(b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least
one and no more than three areas for improvement for each visualization. <strong>The
peer review should include comments on both the code leading up to the
visualization, and the visualization itself</strong>.</p>
<p>Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this
portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to
denigrate. <strong>Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated</strong>. Any
comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the
code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your
feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.</p>
<h4 id="presentation">Presentation</h4>
<p>Week 10 will include each student sharing their portfolio with the class.</p>
<p>I encourage you to present using HTML slides produced via R Markdown
(specifically <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html">xaringan</a>),
but this is not required.</p>
<p><strong>Prior to the start of Week 10</strong> please send me a link to your
published presentation. I will then pre-load all the presentations in different
tabs on my computer.</p>
<p>You will have approximately five minutes to share your portfolio (the amount of
time will vary depending on the enrollment of the class). Please cover the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Briefly show each visualization</li>
<li>Pick 1-2 to go more in-depth, and discuss
<ul>
<li>Intended audience</li>
<li>Design choices, e.g.
<ul>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Choice of specific type of plot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prior version(s) and how the changes helped clarity, communication, beauty,
etc.</li>
<li>At least 1 major challenge encountered along the way</li>
<li>At least 1 major victory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="product">Product</h4>
<p>The final project must include</p>
<ul>
<li>A web-deployed portfolio showcasing your <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DataViz&amp;src=tyah">#dataviz</a>
skills.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/radix/">radix</a>
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html">R Markdown</a> or
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a> website</li>
<li>Technical document with <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown">pagedown</a> or
<a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown</a></li>
<li>Scientific poster with <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown">pagedown</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/">flexdashboard</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At least three finalized data displays, with each accompanied by a strong
narrative/story, as well as the history of how the visualization changed over
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must show iterations of your data displays, highlighting how
they evolved over time and why you made the specific changes you did. If you go
the website route, a blog post showing your visualizations and their evolution
would work great. Dashboards similarly have built in mechanisms to help show
the history of plot.</p>
<p>The final project is required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible.
It will be graded on the following three criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least three different visualizations (30 points; 10 points each)
<ul>
<li>Design choices</li>
<li>Plot appropriate for given audience</li>
<li>Evolution of the plot is clear</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reproducibility (20 points)
<ul>
<li>Should be housed on GitHub</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll clone and try to reproduce</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deployment (10 points)
<ul>
<li>Should be shareable via a link</li>
<li>No errors in the specific chosen format</li>
<li>Clear, clean, easy to follow/understand</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>There is one opportunity for extra credit, which is s worth up to 10
points, and is an in-depth self-study of a topic not explicitly covered
in the class. Students opting into the extra credit option will provide a 10
minute presentation on their chosen topic to the
class (presentations are likely to occur on lab days). For example,
interactive and animated graphics are not explicitly covered, but newer packages
like <a href="https://gganimate.com/index.html">gganimate</a> are powerful and fun. We also
will only have a quick introduction to geographic mapping, and network data will
not be covered at all. Any of these topics
would be excellent choices for a presentation. You could also choose an area
that is covered in the class, but provide greater depth (e.g., color). It is
also important to keep in mind that this course is about communicating <strong>and</strong>
transforming data, and so topics on data transformations would also be
appropriate. For example, you may choose to present on integrating R with SQL
databases. If you are interested in giving a 10 minute talk on a topic of your
choice, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to obtain approval on
the topic and set a date for the presentation.</p>

<h2 id="attendance-and-absence-guidelines">Attendance and Absence Guidelines</h2>
<p>Attendance at all class and discussion groups is expected and required, as described above.</p>
<p>Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or emergencies that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left on the instructor&rsquo;s voice mail or e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to class. If no prior arrangements have been made before class time, the absence will be unexcused. Excused absences will involve make-up assignments, with make-up assignment procedures to be discussed in class on the first day.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete an assignment due to a personal and/or family emergency, you should contact your instructor or discussion leader as soon as possible. On a case-by-case basis, the instructor will determine whether the emergency qualifies as an excused absence.</p>
<h2 id="expected-classroom-behavior">Expected Classroom Behavior</h2>
<p>Students are expected to participate in classroom activities. If use of digital devices or engagement in other non-class activities during class for purposes not regarding classroom activities is critically necessary, the student should engage in these activities while on break, or check with the instructor to arrange for a 10-minute break for unusual circumstances, but only if critically necessary.</p>
<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>
<h3 id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion">Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h3>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students.  To do so requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.</li>
<li>promote a culture of respect throughout the University community.</li>
<li>respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.</li>
<li>reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.</li>
<li>practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.</li>
<li>promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation status, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.</p>
<h3 id="indigenous-recognition-statement">Indigenous Recognition Statement</h3>
<p>The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Today, descendants are citizens of the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon and the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz Indians of Oregon, and they continue to make important contributions in their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.</p>
<h3 id="using-pronouns-and-personal-preference">Using Pronouns and Personal Preference</h3>
<p>The College of Education is always working to include and engage everyone. One way we can do this is to share our pronouns, or the words we want to be called when people aren’t using our name. Like names, pronouns are an important part of how we identify ourselves. Because we recognize that assuming someone’s gender can be hurtful, especially to members of our community who are transgender, genderqueer, or non-binary. This practice can assist in promoting respectful communication. As a community, we are all learning together about the importance of pronouns and being better allies to the trans community on campus. If you would like to ensure clarity around pronouns, please feel free to share any pronouns you would prefer me to use when referring to you to help me be aware of how to address you respectfully. Please visit this university website for more information. <a href="https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns">https://studentlife.uoregon.edu/pronouns</a></p>
<h3 id="children-in-class">Children in class</h3>
<p>I applaud all of you who go to graduate school with children! I had both of my girls while a doctoral student, and I understand the difficulty in balancing academic, work, and family commitments. I want you to succeed. Here are my policies regarding children in class:</p>
<ol>
<li>All breastfeeding babies are welcome in class as often as necessary.</li>
<li>Non-nursing babies and older children are welcome whenever alternate arrangements cannot be made. As a parent of two young children, I understand that babysitters fall through, partners have conflicting schedules, children get sick, and other issues arise that leave parents with few other options.</li>
<li>In cases where children come to class, I invite parents/caregivers to sit close to the door so as to more easily excuse yourself to attend to your child&rsquo;s needs. Non-parents in the class: please reserve seats near the door for your parenting classmates.</li>
<li>All students are expected to join with me in creating a welcoming environment that is respectful of your classmates who bring children to class.</li>
</ol>
<p>I understand that sleep deprivation and exhaustion are among the most difficult aspects of parenting young children. The struggle of balancing school, work, childcare, and graduate school is tiring, and I will do my best to accommodate any such issues while maintaining the same high expectations for all students enrolled in the class. <em><strong>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="documented-disability">Documented Disability</h3>
<p>Appropriate accommodations will be provided for students with documented disabilities. If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, arrange to meet with the course instructor within the first two weeks of the term. The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Accessible Education Center in the Office of Academic Advising and Student Services.  Disabilities may include (but are not limited to) neurological impairment, orthopedic impairment, traumatic brain injury, visual impairment, chronic medical conditions, emotional/psychological disabilities, hearing impairment, and learning disabilities. For more information on Accessible Education Center, please see <a href="http://aec.uoregon.edu">http://aec.uoregon.edu</a></p>
